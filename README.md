### 👋 Hey, I'm Charlotte

I'm a recent graduate from Northcoders Coding Bootcamp and am currently looking for my first Junior Developer role. For more information you can see my portfolio site <a href='https://www.charlotteianson.com/'>here</a>! 😄

### 🌱 Currently working on... 

A Foraging app using React Native. I wanted to learn more about mobile development and thought that because of my prior React knowledge React Native would be a good place to start. After building a few mini apps I've started working on a larger scale project called Gather. I wanted to blend my love of the outdoors and foraging with technology, and so have begun building an app with foraging tips, recipes, and a map where you can save your foraging spots.
